## Real Estate Price Prediction with Linear Regression - Bangalore Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for a project that predicts real estate house prices in Bangalore, India, using linear regression. It also includes a basic web application built with Python to interact with the trained model.

**Abstract:**

Predicting house prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market. This project utilizes linear regression, a machine learning technique, to estimate house prices in Bangalore based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and location. We train a model on a Bangalore house price dataset and evaluate its performance. Additionally, a simple Flask application allows users to interact with the model and predict house prices based on user-provided features.

* Bangalore House Prices
* Flask Application

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:** Refer to `requirements.txt` for the specific Python libraries needed (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, streamlit).

3. **Explore the data:** The Bangalore house price dataset is located in the `data` folder.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:** Run the Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and potentially visualizing the results.

5. **Run the web application:** 

   a. Navigate to the `app` folder.
   b. Ensure you have streamlit installed (`pip install streamlit`).
   c. Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`.
   d. Access the application in your web browser at provided address in the terminal.

**Project Structure:**

* `dataset`: Contains the Bangalore house price dataset.
* `app`: Contains the streamlit application code for user interaction.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries for this project.
* `README.md`: This file (you are reading it now).

**Model Development:**

The project utilizes linear regression to model the relationship between house prices and features like area, number of bedrooms, location, etc. This involves:

* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)
* Training the linear regression model
* Evaluating model performance (metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error)

**Web Application (Flask):**

A basic Streamlit application is included to demonstrate user interaction with the trained model. Users can input features like area, number of bedrooms, etc., and the application predicts the house price using the trained model.

**Future Work:**

*  Explore more advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for potentially improved prediction accuracy.
*  Integrate additional features into the model (e.g., amenities, location details).
*  Develop a more user-friendly and visually appealing web application framework.
*  Deploy the web application to a cloud platform for wider accessibility.

**Contribution:**

We welcome contributions to this project. Feel free to fork the repository, improve the model or web application, and submit pull requests.
